# LR_Report_for_non_Technical
This report is based on an assignment from MSc degree and it includes model selection process and interpretation of all steps for non technical people. 

The dataset can be found on this link;

I used a small part of data only and I have to select only a Linear Regression Model using all of my dataset for training my model instead of using 1/5 of it as test data, due to assignment restrictions. The aim was selecting a model with using all of the dataset and measure the prediction performance of selected model with test data. It resulted with a less fitted model and I used log(x)+1 for transforming some variables, which may mislead my model because of changing original dataset. However, I did not allowed to use any other ML models like at least GLM for model selection. So I tried to do my best for getting better prediction results with unseen data. 

This report is prepared in MS Word and aimed to interpred all steps to non-technical people.
